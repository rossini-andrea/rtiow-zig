# Raytracing in One Weekend

I like to learn new languages, expecially the modern safe alternatives to native languages. For this project i used Zig and followed the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book. This gave me good insights, I might expand the project by importing stuff from my Joytracer, left stuck at implementing materials after poking around with blending hacks.
